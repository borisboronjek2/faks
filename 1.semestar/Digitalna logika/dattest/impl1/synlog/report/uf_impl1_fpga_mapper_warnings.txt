@W: MO129 :"c:\users\boris\dattest\serial_tx.vhd":78:1:78:2|Sequential instance I1.R_byte_old[7] is reduced to a combinational gate by constant propagation.
@W: BN132 :"c:\users\boris\dattest\serial_tx.vhd":78:1:78:2|Removing instance I1.R_byte_old[2] because it is equivalent to instance I1.R_byte_old[0]. To keep the instance, apply constraint syn_preserve=1 on the instance.
